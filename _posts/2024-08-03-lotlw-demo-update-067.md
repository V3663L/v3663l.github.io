Hey all,

I have released a small update to the demo today!

Change list:

- Weapon rebalance: Changed weapon stats and doubled their damage to make combat more engaging.
- New audio: Ambient SFX, crafting SFX, achievement SFX, door SFX, ...
- Better faction rewards: Locul faction items now give more health.
- Minor faction reputation changes: Bigger penalty for kills, Chaos faction reputation.

And there's probably more I've forgotten! It's been a long while since the last demo update...

Since the Steam changes, the players can now review demos, so please do that!

Also, a recently updated full version of the game is currently available on my Discord server.
It has a whole new quest, a new overworld area, new weapons, new abilities, endgame rarity changes, and more!

Have fun and until next time!
