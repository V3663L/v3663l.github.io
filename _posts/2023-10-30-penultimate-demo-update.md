Hi all,

Just dropping an update to the demo as I have recently completed the work on Magic of Spring.
This is the last demo update before the release.

The demo remains essentially unchanged, just a bunch of minor things.

Meanwhile, my publisher's team is working on localization, which I was told could take up to a month, so for now release is at least that far away.

Thank you
