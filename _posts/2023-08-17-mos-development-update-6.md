Hi all,

Last week I finished making card battles for Area 3, the final area of the game, meaning the game is completed gameplay-wise!

What is left is to finish placing Area 3 visuals, update a few old features to match the new layout of the game, do a number of polishing changes, and the game will be ready to ship!
That about sums it up.

I'm not sure how long that will take, but hopefully under a month from now.

See you then!
