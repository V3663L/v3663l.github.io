Hi all, dropping another QoL update!

Change list:

* Vendor in Rift region now sells crafting items in large quantities.
* Holding [control] button or [Right stick] on controllers now allows buying and applying full stacks of crafting items.
* You can now move during the Machine explosion cutscene and end the mission early.
* Fixed: Limitless inventory mode would not remove inventory restrictions in story missions.
* Fixed: If the player has XP to level Ascension more than once, leveling up Ascension level for the first time does not award Ancesion Reactor.
* Fixed: A crash that occurs when the game state is restarted.
* Fixed: A crash that occurs when switching to the Portuguese language.

Have fun!

*And don't forget to review the game, we're only one away from 200!*
