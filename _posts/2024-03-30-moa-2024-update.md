Hi all,

I have just released a small update for Magic of Autumn: Updated credits and intro to show V3663L, my new studio / artist name.

Also, this version is compiled from the new game engine version and with the new Steam SDK, meaning the game might run better now.

I noticed a while ago that the game barely reaches 40 FPS on my machines for some reason - I believe that is because of the old compiler.

Now it seems to be working at stable 60 FPS, so, good news to everyone who may have experienced the same problem.

Please report any problems that may occur due to an update so I can fix them.

Thanks for playing this little game of mine!
