Hey all,

It's been a tough few months, but I'm happy to say I've managed to get through it!
The final quest in Light of the Locked World's story campaign quest series is finished!

It's been a main hurdle preventing the game from being released.

I'd love to say that "LOTLW Launches Globally Month/Day 2025" - but first, I need to discuss the future of Light of the Locked World with the game's publisher.

Meanwhile, I'm running tests with my friends and we got a ton of ideas of how to continuously improve the game!

Hope to be back with more good news soon!
