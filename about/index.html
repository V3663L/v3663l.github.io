<p>Hi~</p>
	
<p>I'm Phoebe, founder and game director of this studio.</p>

<p>I've began working on games in 2013, using GameMaker engine.</p>

<p>As a solo developer, I'm familiar with all aspects of game development.</p>

<p>[ vessel ] wasn't always [ vessel ], much like I've not always been who I am now.</p>
	
<p>It used to be "Games by Zuurix", "Zuurix", "Small Moons" ... And now it is V3663L - - - -</p>
	
<p>And I used to pretend that I was someone else. Well, not anymore because I'm absolutely, totally transgender >,..,<</p>

<p>My goal is to convey the extreme feelings of rage, melancholy, euphoria, all the complicated mess that is being transgender...</p>

<p>And being me, seeing world as I do, wishing for something different, better.</p>
	
<p>So prepare to experience something strange and - hopefully - powerful within my future titles.</p>
